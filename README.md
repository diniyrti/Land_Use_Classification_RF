# Sentinel-2 & Terrain-Driven Land Use Classification

The integration of terrain attributes into the Random Forest classifier yielded a substantial performance boost, increasing the Overall Accuracy (OA) from 84% to 93%. While Scenario 1 only used spectral bands—where SWIR and Blue bands were primary drivers—it faced inherent limitations due to spectral confusion between classes with similar reflectance profiles, such as different types of vegetation. The inclusion of DEM Elevation, which emerged as the most dominant predictor with a 21.83% importance value, provided a critical vertical dimension that allowed the model to effectively stratify land cover types that are topographically dependent, significantly reducing misclassification in complex landscapes.

Scientific literature suggests that terrain variables serve as vital proxies for environmental gradients, including soil moisture, temperature, and microclimates, which directly influence the spatial distribution of land use. Attributes like Slope and the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) enable the algorithm to distinguish between lowland hydrological features (e.g., paddy fields) and upland forest covers that might otherwise share overlapping spectral signatures. This synergy between multi-spectral data and topographic context effectively mitigates "spectral noise", resulting in a land use map that is not only statistically more accurate but also geomorphologically consistent.
